Implements Clean Architecture as described by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) here:    
[Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

This is an opinionated package that defines levels of the architecture and the dependencies between them.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require giacomomasseron/php-clean-architecture
```

After the installation, you must run the *install* command to publish the *deptrac.yaml* and the *php-clean-architecture.yaml* config files to your root folder:
```bash
vendor/bin/php-clean-architecture install
```

## Getting started

To check the architecture levels in your project, use the following command:

```bash
vendor/bin/php-clean-architecture check
```

### Commands

All commands read the *php-clean-architecture.yaml* config file to know where to put the files created and which namespace they belong to.

#### Make Entity

To create an Entity, you can use the following command:

```bash
vendor/bin/php-clean-architecture make:entity EntityInYourProject
```

#### Make Repository

To create a Repository, you can use the following command:

```bash
vendor/bin/php-clean-architecture make:repository UserRepository
```

#### Make UseCase

To create a UseCase, you can use the following command:

```bash
vendor/bin/php-clean-architecture make:usecase DoSomethingUseCase
```

#### Make Controller

To create a Controller, you can use the following command:

```bash
vendor/bin/php-clean-architecture make:controller UserController
```

#### Make Service

To create a Service, you can use the following command:

```bash
vendor/bin/php-clean-architecture make:service ThirdyPartyService
vendor/bin/php-clean-architecture make:service ThirdyParty
```

In both cases, the created class will be named *ThirdyPartyService*.

## Why Clean Architecture?

Why not?  
It is a well-known, well-structured architecture system.

## Concepts

### Architecture Level

In the Clean Architecture, a level is a layer of the architecture with a specific function, **only connected to the upper level**.

The rule of thumb of the Clean Architecture is:  
**An inner circle must never know anything about the circles around it**.

### UseCase

UseCase is a concept of Use Cases level.

A UseCase is every action your project performs.  
Good examples of use cases are:
- Login
- Register
- CompleteOrder
- UpdateProfile

**A use case should be a single, very specific action. It shouldnâ€™t do anything more than its name suggests.**

## How it works

The package uses [deptrac](https://github.com/deptrac/deptrac) to define the levels and to check the dependencies between them.

### Levels

These are the levels defined:

- Entity
- Repository
- UseCase
- Controller
- Service

These are the dependencies between the levels:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Controller-->UseCase-->Repository;
    UseCase-->Service;
    Repository-->Service;
    Repository-->Entity;
```

The *Entity* level must not depend on any other level.  
The *Repository* level can only depend on *Entity* or *Service* levels.  
The *UseCase* level can only depend on *Repository* or *Service* levels.  
The *Controller* level can only depend on *UseCase* levels.

**What is the Service level?**
The Service level can be used for third-party tools or libraries.

### Define a level inside the project

The package comes with these interfaces:

- **EntityInterface**: implement this interface if the class belongs to the Entity level.
- **RepositoryInterface**: implement this interface if the class belongs to the Repository level.
- **UseCaseInterface**: implement this interface if the class belongs to the UseCase level.
- **ControllerInterface**: implement this interface if the class belongs to the Controller level.

For classes that belong to the Service level, the class name must contain the *Service* word.
For example:

```php
final public class ThirdPartyService
```


If you want your controller to be part of the Controller level, you need to implement the ControllerInterface.  
For example:

```php
use GiacomoMasseroni\PHPCleanArchitecture\Contracts\ControllerInterface;

public class YourController implements ControllerInterface
```

### UseCases

When you create a UseCase, the class needs to extend the BaseUseCase class, and you need to implement the UseCaseInterface.
For example:

```php
use GiacomoMasseroni\PHPCleanArchitecture\BaseUseCase;
use GiacomoMasseroni\PHPCleanArchitecture\Contracts\UseCaseInterface;

public class DoSomething extends BaseUseCase implements UseCaseInterface
{
    public function handle(...$arguments): mixed
    {
        //
    }
}
```

To execute the UseCase, you need to call the *run* method defined in the BaseUseCase class:

```php
DoSomething::run($arg1, $arg2);
```


## CI/CD

If you want to check the architecture levels in your CI/CD pipeline, you can use the following command:

```bash
vendor/bin/php-clean-architecture check
```

This command will stop your pipeline if there are architecture violations, based on the deptrac configuration file.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
